# Validating function arguments

This is a repo of code for presenting the amount of work that would need to go into some JavaScript code for ensuring that the arguments passed to a function are valid before using them in a function.

The intention is to prove that writing TypeScript is not as hard as it appears and could actually be easier than writing production ready JavaScript.

Presentation order:

1. Intro
1. simpleFunction
1. multiArgFunction
1. functionArgFunction
1. Fish
1. Book
1. Improvements/Questions?
